## What is scripting and how is it different to coding/programming?

A scripting language is a language where instructions are written for a run time environment.  
They are used to manipulate, customize, and automate the facilities of an existing system.  
The difference between a scripting language and a programming language is that scripting languages do not need an additional step of compilation because they are interpreted,  whereas programming languages are compiled, and  they need a compilation step to convert the high-level language to machine code.


## Why are scripts useful? How are they used?
Scripts are used for the automation of processes on a local computer.
Scripts are useful for several reasons e.g.
- Time saving - Scripts can carry out complex tasks automatically, without intervention of the network administrator, so the admin can focus on other tasks while the scrips runs.
- consistency - a script only needs to be written once and can be used multiple times.
- Flexibility - you could write a script to check weather a file exists and delete it if it does or display an error message if it doesn't.


Why Python for scripting? Why not another language?
